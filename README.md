# Symbolic Recursion Engine

A self-reflective interpreter framework for simulating recursive symbolic cognition.

---

## Overview

This project implements a minimal prototype of a recursive symbolic engine. It consists of a small set of modules that simulate symbolic memory, interpretation, observer feedback, and recursive state updates. The goal is to provide a transparent, non-neural foundation for experimenting with symbolic recursion and abstraction.

The system operates entirely on explicit symbols rather than statistical embeddings and maintains persistent state across executions.

## Features

- Recursive symbolic interpreter (`mirror0.py`)
- Persistent memory and state evolution (`memory.py`)
- Observer input and feedback loop (`observer.py`)
- I/O handling and logging abstraction (`io_handler.py`)
- Configurable runtime behaviour via `config.yaml`
- Seed and data files for symbolic input and output
- Deterministic + stochastic symbolic dynamics
- No neural networks or machine learning

## What This Is
  
- Explicit symbol manipulation (no vectors or embeddings)  
- Persistent symbolic memory  
- Recursive state updates  
- Fully interpretable internal representations  

---

## What This Is Not

- Not GPT or LLM-based  
- Not neural or statistical learning  
- Not probabilistic text generation
